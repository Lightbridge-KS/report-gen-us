# Liver Abnormal Findings

### Parenchymatous Liver Disease

```markdown
**Liver:** Normal size and (mildly) `[increased | coarse]` parenchymal echogenicity. No focal lesion.
**IMPRESSION:**
- (Mild) parenchymatous disease of the liver without focal lesion.
```

### Fatty Liver

#### Mild Fatty Liver

```markdown
**Liver:** Normal size with mildly increased parenchymal echogenicity of the liver. No focal lesion.
**IMPRESSION:**
- Mild fatty liver without focal lesion.
```

#### Moderate Fatty Liver

```markdown
**Liver:** Normal size with diffusely increased parenchymal echogenicity of the liver, causing imparied visualization of intrahepatic vasculature. No focal lesion.
**IMPRESSION:**
- Moderate fatty liver without focal lesion.
```

#### Severe Fatty Liver

```markdown
**Liver:** Normal size with diffusely increased parenchymal echogenicity of the liver, causing imparied visualization of intrahepatic vasculature and right hemidiaphragm. No focal lesion.
**IMPRESSION:**
- Severe fatty liver without focal lesion.
```

#### Focal Fat Sparing 

If focal fat sparing area is present, add the following line in the `liver` field after the fatty liver sentence.

```markdown
**Liver:** <fatty_liver_findings>. Geographic hypoechoic areas `[at | adjacent to]` `[periportal region | gallbladder fossa]`, likely a focal fat sparing.
**IMPRESSION:**
- <fatty_liver_impression> with focal fat sparing at <focal_fat_sparing_location>
```

Example:

```markdown
**Liver:** Normal size with mildly increased parenchymal echogenicity of the liver. Geographic hypoechoic areas at periportal region, likely a focal fat sparing. No gross mass.
**IMPRESSION:**
- Severe fatty liver with focal fat sparing at periportal region.
```

### Cirrhosis

```markdown
**Liver:** `[Normal size | Enlarged caudate lobe]` with diffusely coarsen parenchymal echogenicity and surface nodularity. Portal vein enlarged, measuring ___ cm. No focal lesion.
**Spleen:** `[Normal in size | Spleenomegaly]`.
**IMPRESSION:**
- Liver cirrhosis without focal lesion.
