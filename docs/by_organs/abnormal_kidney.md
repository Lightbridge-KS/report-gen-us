# Kidney Findings


Order findings as:
1. Kidney size and echogenicity
2. (If any) Renal cyst(s)
3. (If any) Renal stone, hydronephrosis, or solid mass.

**Kidneys:** <kidney_size_echo>. <renal_cyst>. <renal_stone_hydro_solid_mass>.
```


### (Chronic) Parenchymatous Kidney Disease

Definition: 

"Parenchymatous kidney disease" := normal kidney size but increased echogenicity. 
"Chronic parenchymatous kidney disease" := small kidney size and increased echogenicity. 

If one kidney is abnormal and the other is normal, report findings for each kidneys. 

Here is the format:

```markdown
**Kidneys:** `[Normal | Small]` size with (mildly) increased parenchymal echogenicity of the `[right | left | both]` kidney(s). No stone, hydronephrosis or solid mass.
**IMPRESSION:**
- (Chronic) parenchymatous disease of `[right | left | both]` kidney(s).
```

Examples:

- Parenchymatous right kidney and normal left kidney:

```markdown
**Kidneys:** Normal size with mildly increased parenchymal echogenicity of the right kidney. Normal size and parenchymal echogenicity of left kidney. No stone, hydronephrosis or solid mass.
**IMPRESSION:**
- Parenchymatous disease of right kidney.
```

- Chronic parenchymatous of both kidneys:

```markdown
**Kidneys:** Small size with increased parenchymal echogenicity of both kidneys. No stone, hydronephrosis or solid mass.
**IMPRESSION:**
- Chronic parenchymatous disease of both kidneys.
```

### Renal Cyst(s)

Here is how to report renal cyst according to Bosniak classification system.

#### Bosniak 1 (Simple Cyst)

Use this phase: "simple cortical cyst(s)" with <quantifier> as described in the english style guide.

```markdown
**Kidneys:** Normal size and parenchymal echogenicity of both kidneys. <quantifier> simple cortical cyst(s) at `[right | left | both]` kidney(s). No stone, hydronephrosis or solid mass.
**IMPRESSION:**
- <quantifier> simple `[right | left | bilateral]` cyst(s)
```

Examples:

```markdown
**Kidneys:** Normal size and parenchymal echogenicity of both kidneys. A 0.5-cm simple cortical cyst at right kidney. No stone, hydronephrosis or solid mass.
**IMPRESSION:**
- A 0.5-cm simple right renal cyst.
```

```markdown
**Kidneys:** Normal size and parenchymal echogenicity of both kidneys. A few simple cortical cysts at both kidneys, measuring up to 2.0 cm. No stone, hydronephrosis or solid mass.
**IMPRESSION:**
- A few simple bilateral renal cysts, measuring up to 2.0 cm.
```

### Renal Stone

```markdown
**Kidneys:** Normal size and parenchymal echogenicity of both kidneys. <quantifier> non-obstructing caliceal stone(s) at `[right | left | both]` kidney(s).  No hydronephrosis or solid mass.
**IMPRESSION:**
- <quantifier> non-obstructing caliceal stone(s) at `[right | left | both]` kidney(s)
```

Examples:

```markdown
**Kidneys:** Normal size and parenchymal echogenicity of both kidneys. A few non-obstructing caliceal stones at right kidney.  No hydronephrosis or solid mass.
**IMPRESSION:**
- A few non-obstructing caliceal stones at right kidney.
```
